# ADJUTORIX

ADJUTORIX is a governed mutation, ledger, replay, and verification workspace built as a multi-package monorepo.

## Repository Layout

- `packages/adjutorix-agent` — execution, governance, ledger, replay, storage, verification
- `packages/adjutorix-app` — desktop application surface
- `packages/adjutorix-cli` — command-line operator surface
- `packages/orchestrator` — startup, shutdown, capability, dependency, and runtime guard orchestration
- `packages/shared` — canonical cross-package contracts, invariants, runtime types, and protocol surface
- `scripts` — operator entrypoints
- `tests` — repository-level contract, invariant, replay, recovery, performance, and end-to-end coverage
- `configs` — policy, CI, contracts, runtime, and tooling configuration

## Core Operating Rules

- no invisible mutation
- no direct write bypass around governed flows
- no unverifiable claim of state
- no replay ambiguity
- no renderer authority over protected mutation paths

## Primary Operator Commands

bash ./scripts/check.sh
bash ./scripts/smoke.sh
bash ./scripts/verify.sh

````

## Workspace Commands
